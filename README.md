This is a public repository aimed specifically at developers using the Tallyfy API. 

To view our Swagger documentation, please go to go.tallyfy.com/api

If you have API questions - please post them here! All other issues should be reported to support@tallyfy.com

## Posting guidelines
1. No inappropriate/offensive language. We reserve the right to edit/remove any post which is deemed inappropriate or offensive by Tallyfy.

2. Check first that the issue you are reporting has not already been reported elsewhere. If it has been reported in another ticket, you may give that ticket a [+1] and/or comment additional helpful information so that we may deal with the issue in the most complete manner possible.

3. Avoid using any uniquely identifiable information in your posts/comments. This includes but is not limited to user ID's, org ID's, user emails, etc. To represent these identifiers in your tickets, we encourage you to user curly braces around the identifierâ€™s name, such as `{org_id}` or `{user_id}`.

4. When reporting an issue, always include these pieces of information:<br>
  a. URL (with identifiers removed)<br>
  b. Verb (`GET`, `POST`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`)<br>
  c. Request payload and headers<br>
  d. Response and response code<br>
